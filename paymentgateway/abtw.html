                demonstrate God’s love by alleviating human suffering in the U.S. and around the world. For more than
                40 years, your love has shown through OB as together we’ve provided hunger relief, medical care, clean

                Through compassionate, efficient, and locally-focused programs we are able to target the specific needs
                 of those we serve and provide a gateway for our partners to truly be the hands and feet of Jesus for 
                 those who are suffering and in need.</p>
